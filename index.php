                teve Paul "Steve" Jobs February 24, 1955 _ October 5, 2011) was an American information technology entrepreneur and inventor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief Executive Officer"><a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief Executive Officer">(CEO)</a> of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>.;<a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief Executive Officer"><a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief Executive Officer">(CEO)</a> and majority shareholder of Pixar Animation Studios; a member of The<a class="anc" href="http://www.disney.com/" title="walt disney"> Walt Disney</a> Company's board of directors following its acquisition of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar" title="pixar">Pixar</a>; and founder, chairman, and <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief Executive Officer">(CEO)</a> of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> Inc. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s, along with <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> co-founder Steve Wozniak. Shortly after his death, Jobs's official biographer, Walter Isaacson, described him as a "creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Jobs's countercultural lifestyle and philosophy was a product of the time and place of his upbringing. Jobs was adopted at birth in San Francisco, and raised in a hotbed of counterculture, the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1960s. As a senior at Homestead High School in <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California" title="Cupertino, California"> Cupertino, California</a>, his two closest friends were the older engineering student (and Homestead High alumnus) Wozniak and his girlfriend, the artistically inclined and countercultural Homestead High junior Chrisann Brennan. Jobs and Wozniak bonded over their mutual fascination with Jobs's musical idol Bob Dylan, discussing his lyrics and collecting bootleg reel-to-reel tapes of Dylan's concerts. Jobs later dated Joan Baez who notably had a prior relationship with Dylan. Jobs briefly attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out. He then decided to travel through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. Jobs's declassified FBI report says an acquaintance knew that Jobs used illegal drugs in college including marijuana and LSD. Jobs told a reporter once that taking LSD was one of the two or three most important things he did in his life. Jobs co-founded <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> in 1976 to sell Wozniak's <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> I personal computer. The duo gained fame and wealth a year later for the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. In 1979, after a tour of Xerox PARC, Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to development of the unsuccessful <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> Lisa in 1983, followed by the very successful Macintosh in 1984. In addition to being the first mass-produced computer with a GUI, the Macintosh instigated the sudden rise of the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Following a long power struggle, Jobs was forced out of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> in 1985. After leaving <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>, Jobs took a few of its members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in state-of-the-art computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, Jobs helped to initiate the development of the visual effects industry when he funded the spinout of the computer graphics division of George Lucas's company Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company,  <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar" title="pixar">Pixar</a>, would eventually produce the first fully computer-animated film, Toy StoryÃ¢â‚¬â€an event made possible in part because of Jobs's financial support. In 1997, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> purchased NeXT, allowing Jobs to become the former's <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief Executive Officer">(CEO)</a> once again. He would return the company, which was on the verge of bankruptcy, back to profitability. Beginning in 1997 with the "Think different" advertising campaign, Jobs worked closely with designer Jonathan Ive to develop a line of products that would have larger cultural ramifications: the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac" title="imac"> iMac</a>, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes" title="itunes">iTunes</a>, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> Stores, the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod" title="iPod">iPod</a>, the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes" title="itunes">iTunes</a> Store, the <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iphone">iPhone</a>, the App Store, and the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad" title="ipad"> iPad</a>.

                Mac OS was also revamped into Mac OS X, based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003 and died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor on October 5, 2011.

            Jobs's adoptive father, Paul Reinhold Jobs (1922_1993), grew up in a Calvinist household, the son of an "alcoholic and sometimes abusive" father. The family lived on a farm in Germantown, Wisconsin. Paul, ostensibly bearing a resemblance to James Dean, had tattoos, dropped out of high school, and traveled around the midwest for several years during the 1930s looking for work. He eventually joined the United States Coast Guard as an engine-room machinist. After World War II, Paul Jobs decided to leave the Coast Guard when it docked in San Francisco. He made a bet that he would find his wife in San Francisco and promptly went on a blind date with Clara Hagopian (1924_1986). They were engaged ten days later and married in 1946. Clara, the daughter of Armenian immigrants, grew up in San Francisco and had been married before, but her husband had been killed in the war. After a series of moves, Paul and Clara settled in San Francisco's Sunset District in 1952. As a hobby, Paul Jobs rebuilt cars, but as a career he was a "repo man", which suited his "aggressive, tough personality." Meanwhile, their attempts to start a family were halted after Clara had an ectopic pregnancy, leading them to explore adoption in 1955. Steve Jobs's biological father, Abdulfattah "John" Jandali (b. 1931), was born into a Muslim household and grew up in Homs, Syria. Jandali is the son of a self-made millionaire who did not go to college and a mother who was a traditional housewife. While an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut, he was a student activist and spent time in jail for his political activities. Although Jandali initially wanted to study law, he eventually decided to study economics and political science. He pursued a PhD in the latter subject at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Carole Schieble, a Catholic of Swiss and German descent, who grew up on a farm in Wisconsin. As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age. Mona Simpson (Jobs's biological sister), notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating Jandali: "it wasn't that he was Middle-Eastern so much as that he was a Muslim. But there are a lot of Arabs in Michigan and Wisconsin. So it's not that unusual." Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs's official biographer, additionally states that Schieble's father "threatened to cut Joanne off completely" if she continued the relationship.

            Schieble became pregnant in 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he "was very much in love with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria. And so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption. Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry. In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me ... she did not want to bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone. Schieble put herself in the care of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions. Schieble gave birth to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, and chose an adoptive couple for him that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy. That couple, however, changed their mind and decided to adopt a girl instead. When the baby boy was then placed with the Bay Area blue collar couple Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers. She then took the matter to court, attempting to have her baby placed with a different family and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after they promised that he would attend college. When Jobs was in high school, Clara admitted to his then-girlfriend, 17-year-old Chrisann Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his life ... I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him." When Chrisann shared this comment with Jobs, he stated that he was aware of it and would later say that he was deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara. Many years later, Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that "he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents." Jobs would become upset when Paul and Clara were referred to as "adoptive parents" as they "were my parents 1,000%. With regard to his biological parents, Jobs referred to them as "my sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more." Jandali has also stated that "I really am not his dad. Mr. and Mrs. Jobs are, as they raised him. And I don't want to take their place."

                    Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957 and the family moved to Mountain View, California in 1961. It was during this time that Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to "pass along his love of mechanics. Jobs meanwhile admired his father's craftsmanship "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad."[2] By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood. He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a loner. Home of Paul and Clara Jobs, on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California. Childhood home of Steve Jobs in Los Altos, California that served as the original site of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> Computer. The home was added to a list of historic Los Altos sites in 2013. As Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom and tended to resist authority figures, he frequently misbehaved and was suspended a few times. As Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, Jobs stated that he was "pretty bored in school and turned into a little terror... you should have seen us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher. At Monta Loma Elementary school in Mountain View, he frequently played pranks on others. However, his father (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, blaming the school instead for not challenging his brilliant son enough.

                    Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene 'Teddy' Hill with turning him around: "She taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation. She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give you five bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen. Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View where he became a "socially awkward loner. Jobs "was often bullied" and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school. Although the Jobs family was not well off, they used all of their savings to buy a new home. Thus in 1967, the Jobs family moved to a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California which was in the better Cupertino School District, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California" title="Cupertino, California"> Cupertino, California</a> (in 2013 when it was owned by Patty and occupied by Jobs's step-mother Marilyn, this home Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the first site for <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> Computer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was declared a historic site). The new house was embedded in an environment that was even more heavily populated with engineering families than the Mountain View home. Bill Fernandez, a fellow electronics hobbyist who was in the same grade as him at Cupertino Junior High, was his first friend after the move. Fernandez later commented that "for some reason the kids in the eighth grade didn't like Jobs because they thought he was odd. I was one of his few friends." Fernandez eventually introduced Jobs to 18-year-old electronics whiz and Homestead High alumn<a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak" title="steve wozniak"> Steve Wozniak</a>, who lived across the street from Fernandez. In mid-1968 when he was 13, Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project: "He didn't know me at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and he got me a job that summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency counters...well, assembling may be too strong. I was putting in screws. It didn't matter; I was in heaven.

        In 1973,<a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak" title="steve wozniak"> Steve Wozniak</a> designed his own version of the classic video game Pong. After finishing it, Wozniak gave the board to Jobs, who then took the game down to Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California. Atari thought that Jobs had built it and gave him a job as a technician. Atari's cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him as "difficult but valuable", pointing out that "he was very often the smartest guy in the room, and he would let people know that. In mid-1972, Jobs moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area and was renting his own apartment. Brennan states by this point that their "relationship was complicated. I couldn't break the connection and I couldn't commit. Steve couldn't either. Jobs hitchhiked and worked around the West Coast and Brennan would occasionally join him. At the same time, Brennan notes, little by little, Steve and I separated. But we were never able to fully let go. We never talked about breaking up or going our separate ways and we didn't have that conversation where one person says it's over. They continued to grow apart, but Jobs would still seek her out, and visit her while she was working in a health food store or as a live-in babysitter.

        They remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people. By early 1973, Jobs was living what Brennan describes as a "simple life" in a Los Gatos cabin, working at Atari, and saving money for his impending trip to India. Brennan visited him twice at the cabin. She states in her memoir that her memories of this cabin consist of Jobs reading Be Here Now (and giving her a copy), listening to South Indian music, and using a Japanese meditation pillow. Brennan felt that he was more distant and negative toward her. Brennan states in her memoir that she met with Jobs right before he left for India and that he tried to give her a $100 bill that he had earned at Atari. She initially refused to accept it but eventually accepted the money. Jobs traveled to India in mid-1974 to visit Neem Karoli Baba at his Kainchi ashram with his Reed friend (and eventual <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> employee) Daniel Kottke, in search of spiritual enlightenment. When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram, it was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973. Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji. In India, they spent a lot of time on bus rides from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. After staying for seven months, Jobs left India and returned to the US ahead of Daniel Kottke. Jobs had changed his appearance; his head was shaved and he wore traditional Indian clothing.[34][35] During this time, Jobs experimented with psychedelics, later calling his LSD experiences "one of the two or three most important things he had done in his life. He spent a period at the All One Farm, a commune in Oregon and Brennan joined him there for a period. During this time period, both Jobs and Brennan became practitioners of Zen Buddhism through the Zen master K?bun Chino Otogawa. Jobs was living with his parents again, in their backyard toolshed which he had converted into a bedroom with a sleeping bag, mat, books, a candle, and a meditation pillow. Jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the oldest Zen monastery in the US. He considered taking up monastic residence at Eihei-ji in Japan, and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen. Jobs would later say that people around him who did not share his countercultural roots could not fully relate to his thinking. Jobs then returned to Atari and was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout. According to Bushnell, Atari offered US$100 for each TTL chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Much to the amazement of Atari engineers, Wozniak reduced the TTL count to 46, a design so tight that it was impossible to reproduce on an assembly line. According to Wozniak, Jobs told him that Atari gave them only $700 (instead of the $5,000 paid out), and that Wozniak's share was thus $350. Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later, but said that if Jobs had told him about it and explained that he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him. Wozniak had designed a low-cost digital "blue box" to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls. Jobs decided that they could make money selling it. The clandestine sales of the illegal "blue boxes" went well and perhaps planted the seed in Jobs's mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable. Jobs, in a 1994 interview, recalled that it took six months for him and Wozniak to figure out how to build the blue boxes. Jobs said that if not for the blue boxes, there would have been no <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>. He states it showed them that they could take on large companies and beat them.

            Jobs founded <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> Inc. in 1985 after his resignation from Apple with $7 million. A year later he was running out of money, and with no product on the horizon, he sought venture capital. Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot who invested heavily in the company. The <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> computer was shown to the world at what was considered Jobs's comeback event, a lavish (invitation only) gala launch event and was described as a multimedia extravaganza. It was held at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, California on Wednesday October 12, 1988. <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> workstations were first released in 1990, priced at US$9,999. Like the Apple Lisa, the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> workstation was technologically advanced, but was largely dismissed as cost-prohibitive by the educational sector for which it was designed. The <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> workstation was known for its technical strengths, chief among them its object-oriented software development system. Jobs marketed <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> products to the financial, scientific, and academic community, highlighting its innovative, experimental new technologies, such as the Mach kernel, the digital signal processor chip, and the built-in Ethernet port. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web on a <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> computer at CERN. The revised, second generation <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a>cube was released in 1990. Jobs touted it as the first "interpersonal" computer that would replace the personal computer. With its innovative <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a>Mail multimedia email system, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a>cube could share voice, image, graphics, and video in email for the first time. "Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork", Jobs told reporters. Jobs ran <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> with an obsession for aesthetic perfection, as evidenced by the development of and attention to <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a>cube's magnesium case. This put considerable strain on <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a>'s hardware division, and in 1993, after having sold only 50,000 machines, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> transitioned fully to software development with the release of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a>STEP/Intel. The company reported its first profit of $1.03 million in 1994. In 1996, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> Software, Inc. released WebObjects, a framework for Web application development. After <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="NEXT">NeXT</a> was acquired by Apple Inc. in 1997, WebObjects was used to build and run the Apple Store, MobileMe services, and the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes" title="itunes">iTunes</a> Store.

                Chrisann Brennan notes that after Jobs was forced out of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>, "he apologized many times over for his behavior" towards her and Lisa. She also states that Jobs "said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry."[20] By this time, Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when she was nine, Jobs had the name on her birth certificate changed from "Lisa Brennan" to "Lisa Brennan-Jobs. In addition, Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to co-parent Lisa, a change Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, Mona Simpson (who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs). Jobs found Mona after first finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>. Jobs did not contact his birth family during Clara's (his adoptive mother) lifetime, however. He would later tell his official biographer Walter Isaacson: "I never wanted [Paul and Clara] to feel like I didn't consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out. However, in 1986 when he was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began to spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother. Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant. Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death. As he died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that "his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble. Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died and after he received permission from his father, Paul. In addition, out of respect for Paul, he asked the media not to report on his search. Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need "to see if she was okay and to thank her, because I'm glad I didn't end up as an abortion. She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me. Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn't familiar with the history of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> or Jobs's role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers. She said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly apologized to him for it. Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend Christmas together. When Jobs died in 2011, Schieble was suffering from dementia and living in a nursing home. She was not told about his death. During this first visit, Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother. Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first impression of Jobs was that "he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy. Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk in order to get to know each other. Jobs later told his biographer that "Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me . . . . As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family. I don't know what I'd do without her. I can't imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close.

                "I grew up as an only child, with a single mother. Because we were poor and because I knew my father had emigrated from Syria, I imagined he looked like Omar Sharif. I hoped he would be rich and kind and would come into our lives (and our not-yet-furnished apartment) and help us. Later, after I'd met my father, I tried to believe he'd changed his number and left no forwarding address because he was an idealistic revolutionary, plotting a new world for the Arab people. Even as a feminist, my whole life I'd been waiting for a man to love, who could love me. For decades, I'd thought that man would be my father. When I was 25, I met that man, and he was my brother." Mona Simpson Jobs then learned his family history. Six months after he was given up for adoption, Schieble's father died, she wed Jandali, and they had a daughter, Mona. Jandali states that after finishing his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962).[2] He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Simpson for a period of time: "I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where she was, but since 10 years ago weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida. A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her step father's last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own. Jobs told his official biographer that after meeting Simpson he wanted to become involved in her ongoing search for their father. When he was found working in Sacramento, they decided that only Simpson would meet him. Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business. He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that "we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone. (Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs). Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that "all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs ... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy and a big tipper. After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that "it was amazing .... I had been to that restaurant a few times, and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands. However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because "I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it . . . . I asked Mona not to tell him about me. Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked "what is this thing about Steve Jobs?" Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive . . . . He never contacted Steve. Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did.[2] Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East. Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, The Lost Father. Jobs first met his future wife, Laurene Powell, in 1989 when she was a student in the Stanford Graduate School of Business and he gave a lecture there. Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene Ã¢â‚¬Å“was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldnt take my eyes off of her . . . kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy.Ã¢â‚¬Â[21] After the lecture, Jobs met up with her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. From that point forward, they were together (with a few minor exceptions) for the rest of his life.[21] Powell's father died when she was very young, and her mother raised her in a middle class New Jersey home similar to the one Jobs grew up in. After she received her B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania she spent a short period in high finance but found it didn't interest her, so she decided to pursue her MBA at Stanford instead. In addition, unlike Jobs, she was athletic and followed professional sports. She also brought as much self-sufficiency to the relationship as he did and was more of a private than public person. Jobs proposed on New Year's Day 1990 with "a fistful of freshly picked wildflowers. They married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. Fifty people, including his father Paul and his sister Mona, attended. The ceremony was conducted by Jobs's guru, Kobun Chino Otogawa. The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite's Half Dome, and the wedding ended with a hike (during which Laurene's brothers had a snowball fight). Jobs is reported to have said to Mona: "You see, Mona [...], Laurene is descended from Joe Namath, and we're descended from John Muir. Jobs and Powell's first child, Reed, was born September 1991. Jobs' father, Paul, died a year and a half later, on March 5, 1993. Jobs and Powell had two more children, Erin, born in August 1995, and Eve, born in 1998.[74] The family lived in Palo Alto, California. A journalist who grew up locally remembered him as owning the house with "the scariest [Hallow'een] decorations in Palo Alto...I don't remember seeing him. I was busy being terrified.

                In 1996, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> announced that it would buy NeXT for $427 million. The deal was finalized in February 1997, bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded. Jobs became de facto chief after then-<a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief Executive Officer">(CEO)</a> Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997. He was formally named interim chief executive in September. In March 1998, to concentrate <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>'s efforts on returning to profitability, Jobs terminated a number of projects, such as Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc. In the coming months, many employees developed a fear of encountering Jobs while riding in the elevator, "afraid that they might not have a job when the doors opened. The reality was that Jobs's summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company."[98] Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines. With the purchase of NeXT, much of the company's technology found its way into <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> products, most notably NeXTSTEP, which evolved into Mac OS X. Under Jobs's guidance, the company increased sales significantly with the introduction of the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac" title="imac"> iMac</a> and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>.

                At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the "interim" modifier from his title at <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> and became permanent <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief Executive Officer">(CEO)</a>.[99] Jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title "i<a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief Executive Officer">(CEO)</a>. The company subsequently branched out, introducing and improving upon other digital appliances. With the introduction of the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod" title="iPod">iPod</a>s portable music player, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes" title="itunes">iTunes</a> digital music software, and the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes" title="itunes">iTunes</a> Store, the company made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution. On June 29, 2007, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> entered the cellular phone business with the introduction of the <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iphone">iPhone</a>, a multi-touch display cell phone, which also included the features of an <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod" title="iPod">iPod</a>s and, with its own mobile browser, revolutionized the mobile browsing scene. While nurturing innovation, Jobs also reminded his employees that "real artists ship. Jobs had a public war of words with Dell Computer <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" title="Chief Executive Officer">(CEO)</a> Michael Dell, starting in 1987, when Jobs first criticized Dell for making "un-innovative beige boxes. On October 6, 1997, at a Gartner Symposium, when Dell was asked what he would do if he ran the then-troubled <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> Computer company, he said: "I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders. Then, in 2006, Jobs sent an email to all employees when <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>'s market capitalization rose above Dell's: Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's stock market close, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today. Steve. Jobs was both admired and criticized for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship, which has been dubbed the "reality distortion field" and was particularly evident during his keynote speeches (colloquially known as "Stevenotes") at Macworld Expos and at <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> Worldwide Developers Conferences. Jobs was a board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002. Two men in their fifties shown full length sitting in red leather chairs smiling at each other Steve Jobs and Bill Gates at the fifth D: All Things Digital conference (D5) in May 2007 In 2001, Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of 7.5 million shares of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> with an exercise price of $18.30. It was alleged that the options had been backdated, and that the exercise price should have been $21.10. It was further alleged that Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of $20,000,000 that he did not report, and that <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> overstated its earnings by that same amount. As a result, Jobs potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties. The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations, though an independent internal <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> investigation completed on December 29, 2006 found that Jobs was unaware of these issues and that the options granted to him were returned without being exercised in 2003. In 2005, Jobs responded to criticism of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>'s poor recycling programs for e-waste in the US by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>'s annual meeting in Cupertino in April. A few weeks later, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> announced it would take back <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod" title="iPod">iPods</a> for free at its retail stores. The Computer TakeBack Campaign responded by flying a banner from a plane over the Stanford University graduation at which Jobs was the commencement speaker. The banner read "Steve, don't be a mini-playerâ€recycle all e-waste." In 2006, he further expanded <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>'s recycling programs to any US customer who buys a new Mac. This program includes shipping and "environmentally friendly disposal" of their old systems. The success of <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>'s unique products and services provided several years of stable financial returns, propelling <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in 2011. Jobs was perceived as a demanding perfectionist who always aspired to position his businesses and their products at the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting innovation and style trends. He summed up this self-concept at the end of his keynote speech at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2007, by quoting ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky: There's an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. "I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been." And we've always tried to do that at <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a>. Since the very, very beginning. And we always will. On July 1, 2008, a US$7 billion class action suit was filed against several members of the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> board of directors for revenue lost because of alleged securities fraud. In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs revealed that he had met with U.S. President Barack Obama, complained about the nation's shortage of software engineers, and told Obama that he was "headed for a one-term presidency. Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a U.S. university should automatically be offered a green card. After the meeting, Jobs commented, "The president is very smart, but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can't get done . . . . It infuriates me.

In 1999, <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> introduced the Graphite gray <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac" title="imac"> iMac</a> and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep.[213] The <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac" title="imac"> iMac</a> sold for $1,299 at that time. The <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac" title="imac"> iMac</a> also featured some technical innovations, such as having <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB" title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</a> ports as the only device inputs. This latter change resulted, through the <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac" title="imac"> iMac</a>'s success, in the interface being popularised among third party peripheral makers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as evidenced by the fact that many early <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB" title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</a> peripherals were made of translucent plastic.

                <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> began work on the first <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iphone">iPhone</a> in 2005 and the first <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iphone">iPhone</a> was released on June 29, 2007. The <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iphone">iPhone</a> created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its release. Time Magazine declared it "Invention of the Year" for 2007. The <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="apple">Apple Inc</a> <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iphone">iPhone</a> is a small device with multimedia capabilities and functions as a quad-band touch screen smartphone. A year later, the <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iphone">iPhone</a> 3G was released in July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. In June 2009, the <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iphone">iPhone</a> 3GS, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller. The <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iphone">iPhone</a> 4 is thinner than previous models, has a five megapixel camera capable of recording video in 720p <a class="anc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD" title="High-definition">HD</a>, and adds a secondary front-facing camera for video calls. A major feature of the <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iphone">iPhone</a> 4S, introduced in October 2011, was Siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice recognition.
